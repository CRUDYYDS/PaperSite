      "abstract": "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).",
